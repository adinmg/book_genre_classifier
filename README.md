**Fine-Tuning with Huggingface Transformer LLM:**
In the first phase of our adventure, experience the unveiling of the nuanced art of predicting book genres. We fine-tune a Huggingface Transformer Language Model (LLM), incorporating cutting-edge technology for enhanced accuracy.

**PEFT/LoRA Technique Unveiled:**
Delve into an additional fine-tuning techniqueâ€”the PEFT/LoRA method. Discover its potential in genre classification, adding sophistication to our model and broadening the scope of precision.

**Scikit-Learn Classification Odyssey:**
Join us on an engaging exploration of scikit-learn's classification saga. Immerse yourself in the world of Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Naive Bayes (NB), and Random Forest (RF) classifiers. Highlighting the distinct strengths of each model, this journey showcases the blend of classical and modern approaches.

**Flask App for Seamless Interaction:**
Beyond technical complexities, experience the user-friendly side of the Book Genre Classifier. Our Flask app provides a smooth interface for users to interact with the classification system, making the exploration of genres an enjoyable and intuitive process.

**Docker Deployment for Efficiency:**
Witness the efficiency of our deployment through Docker. We encapsulate the Book Genre Classifier into a Docker container, ensuring portability and easy replication across different environments.

**Docker Image on the Horizon:**
Explore the encapsulated magic with our Docker image, capturing the essence of precision in book genre classification. This image represents the culmination of our efforts, ready to be shared, tested, and deployed.

**Scaling Up with AWS EC2:**
For those aiming for a broader horizon, we guide you through deploying the Book Genre Classifier on AWS EC2. Scale up the reach of your classifier, making it accessible to a wider audience.

## Why Book Genre Classifier?

It's challenging to determine a book's genre based on its title and summary, but it's essential for several reasons:

- **Enhanced Recommendations:** Elevate book recommendations with a classifier that comprehends genres at a nuanced level, offering users personalized and accurate suggestions.

- **Insights into Literary Trends:** Uncover hidden patterns in literary success by exploring the relationship between book genres and their portrayal in summaries.

- **Recommendation Systems:** A robust genre classifier assists recommendation systems in providing readers with more personalized book recommendations, leading to increased reader engagement on digital platforms.

- **Literary Success:** Understand the correlation between genres and their portrayal in summaries to gain insights into what makes books commercially successful or where improvements can be made.

- **Book Themes and Trends:** Study book genres to better understand the prevailing themes and trends in the publishing industry, providing valuable insights for cultural and societal studies.

## Get Started

Clone the Book Genre Classifier repository and explore the precision of diverse approaches to revolutionize book genre classification.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adinmg/book_genre_classifier.git
```

### Requirements

Ensure a seamless setup by installing the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Flask Integration

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd book_genre_classifier
   ```

2. Run the Flask app:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Access the Book Genre Classifier at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser to interact with the classification system.

## Docker Deployment

1. Ensure Docker is installed on your machine.

2. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t book_classifier-app .
   ```

3. Run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 book_classifier-app
   ```

4. Access the Book Genre Classifier at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser to experience the precision of diverse approaches in book genre classification.

## Test Using Docker Hub Image

1. To test the Book Genre Classifier using the image from Docker Hub, execute the following command:


    ```bash
    docker pull adinmg/book_classifier-app:v1
    ```

2. Run the Docker Container:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 5000:5000 adinmg/book_classifier-app:v1
    ```

This command assumes that the application inside the container exposes port 5000 and maps it to the same port on your host machine.

3. Accessing the Classifier:

After the container is running, you might access the Book Genre Classifier by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
